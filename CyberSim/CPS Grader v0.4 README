CPS Grader v0.4

New Feature List
1. Improved look and size of text on main UI.
2. Full Multi Bot Implementation
3. Filters to prevent lack of Bot in Simulation does not crash app. Extra Statemachines are ignored.
4. Added Beta Automatic Deployment code. Uses Shared Variables and has not been tested on iRobot yet.
	4a. Deploy image to a myRIO.
	4b. Specify myRIO in the Adv. Options
	4c. Select the Deploy? Boolean.
	4d. Run the simulation. If the image is not correct it will remove the target from the list. 
	4e. It will automatically override sensor data for the robot in the simulation. The Sim Robot will move
		and for correct matching between the two Changing the simulation to match your actual environment is
		recommended.
	4f. This deployment option is completely scalable. Currently testing needs to be done to verify
		performance of the actual robot vs. the simulation. In a later version we might need to switch to
		network streams for appropriate performance.
	4g. This works for VI's and DLL's as it is only passing Sensor Data back and forth.
	4h. Added Virtual Environment option which does not overwrite sensor data from the Simulation but still
		outputs sensor data to the robot to drive it. Potentially this could allow the usage of virtual 
		environments to define test area. 
5. Filter on DLLs in the Robot State Charts. Code can only support 1 DLL directly targeted.
	5a. Automatically removes extra DLLs from State Chart List when Start is pressed.
6. Multi DLL Solution Implemented
	6a. Use the Simulation Statechart-DLL Wrapper.vi as the template.
	6b. Make a copy, rename it to something unique, and change the path constant in the VI to point to your
		DLL.
	6c. Use it as you would a LabVIEW State Machine VI in the application. 
7. Re-enabled Statechart Ini code disabled in v0.3. It will now override the first Statechart in the list.

Issues That Need to be Resolved
1. CyberSim Grader DLL needs to be recompiled for LabVIEW 2014.
2. In all original Environment Files there are two problems that prevent quick creation of new environments.
	2a. To fix the problems each environment needs to have its robot removed and re-added.
	2b. Problem 1: Wall Sensor has a space after it in the XML and in the Simulation iRobot Open.vi. 
	2c. Problem 2: All sensors in default iRobot create a robot with sensors in the form "Cliff Sensor_S0".
		Current environment robots do not have this.
